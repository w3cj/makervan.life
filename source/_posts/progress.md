# Things are happening

So I've been working on the van. A few hours here. A few hours there. Progress is being made, slowly, but surely.

## Measurements

**Question:** How much space we working with?

**Answer:** 60 square feet

I made some quick measurements of the floor/walls/roof to see how much materials to by. At this point, the measurements are just approximate. More precise measurements will be made as I install things.

## What's next?

In the next few posts, I'll describe my progress on the insulation/paneling of the floors and walls.
