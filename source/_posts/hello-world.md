Hello! I'm CJ. I'm an Instructor, Full Stack Developer, Maker, Hardware Tinkerer and Technologist.

I will be going on a road trip across the USA starting the end of September. Leading up to my departure date, I'll be building out a van to serve as my base of operations.

I've always loved building and making things, so I'll be building out the van from scratch! I will use this web log to write about my progress and the projects involved.
