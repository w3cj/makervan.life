## It all starts here.

I've been planning and anticipating this day for a while now. It finally happened! I BOUGHT A VAN!

# I present to you, the Maker Vanâ„¢

<small>The term Maker comes from [maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) and the fact that I'll be building the van out myself. Once finished, the van will be a fully mobile maker workshop.</small>

The hard part's over... now I just have to:

* Install insulation
* Install panelling
* Install subfloor
* Install solar/lighting/electrical
* Install roof vents
* Install water tank/sink/plumbing
* Build/install cabinetry/closets
* Build/install desk and a bed
* Whatever else comes up...

Easy enough right? Stay tuned for moar!
